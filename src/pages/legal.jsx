          <h2>Use of the service</h2>
          <p>
            SMPIS provides school administration, student and staff records,
            attendance, academic reporting, school fees, and communication
            tools. Use the service only for authorized school purposes and
            within your assigned role. School policies and applicable law also
            govern your use.
          </p>
          <h2>Accounts and responsibilities</h2>
          <p>
            Keep account credentials and recovery codes private. Do not share
            accounts, access another school's records, bypass safeguards, upload
            malicious material, or submit information you are not authorized to
            provide. Report unauthorized access and inaccurate records to your
            school. School administrators manage account access and may suspend
            misuse.
          </p>
          <h2>School records and decisions</h2>
          <p>
            The school is responsible for the accuracy of its records, lawful
            processing, permissions, retention, and decisions concerning
            learners and staff. Reports and alerts support human review.
            Historical model tools do not authorize automated decisions about
            students. Parents and guardians should submit only information they
            are authorized to provide.
          </p>
          <h2>Fees and external providers</h2>
          <p>
            Your school sets fees, payment terms, concessions, and refund rules.
            External payment providers have their own terms. A payment is
            credited only after server-side verification; disputed or mismatched
            transactions may need finance review. SMPIS does not store full card
            numbers or card security codes.
          </p>
          <h2>Availability and data management</h2>
          <p>
            Maintenance, outages, and external providers may interrupt access.
            Administrators must arrange appropriate backups and recovery.
            Database and private document backups must be managed separately in
            Supabase.
          </p>
          <h2>Privacy, changes, and contact</h2>

            <a href="/cookies">Cookie policy</a>. Material changes will be
            published here. Contact the operator or your school for access,
            payment, or service concerns. These terms do not limit rights or
            remedies that applicable law does not permit the operator to
            exclude.

          <h2>Who handles your information</h2>
          <p>
            The school operating your workspace is responsible for the school
            records it collects and the purposes for using them. The published
            operator contact above handles site-level questions. Ask your school
            about its specific legal basis, retention schedule, and any
            additional privacy notice.
          </p>
          <h2>Information processed</h2>
          <p>
            Depending on your role and the records your school enters,
            information includes account names and email addresses; student and
            guardian contact details; admissions and enrollment; attendance;
            assessment results and reports; school fee invoices and payment
            references; staff employment and HR documents; complaints,
            discipline and survey responses; and security, session and audit
            records. Schools may enter medical or other sensitive information.
            The current system does not collect fingerprint or facial templates.
          </p>
          <h2>Why information is used</h2>
          <p>
            Information supports authorized school operations, learning and
            reporting, staff administration, fee accounting, notifications,
            access control, and investigation of changes or misuse. Schools must
            establish the appropriate legal basis for each use and appropriate
            conditions for sensitive information and children's data. Cookie
            notice acceptance is not blanket permission for these activities.
          </p>
          <h2>Storage and service providers</h2>
          <p>
            The application uses hosted Supabase PostgreSQL and private Supabase
            document storage. Hosting, database and storage providers process
            information needed to provide those services. If configured, the
            school's SMTP provider processes recipient addresses and email
            content, and Paystack processes payment information under its own
            notice. Flutterwave and Twilio credentials can be stored, but
            checkout and SMS delivery through them are not yet implemented. The
            operator must assess any cross-border processing and applicable
            safeguards with its providers.
          </p>
          <h2>Security and access</h2>
          <p>
            Role and school checks restrict access. Passwords are hashed;
            administrator MFA is supported; integration credentials are
            encrypted using a server-held key. Hosted deployments use HTTPS.
            Other record fields are not separately encrypted by application
            code. Authorized administrators and service providers may access
            information as necessary for their duties.
          </p>
          <h2>Retention and your requests</h2>
          <p>
            There is no universal automatic deletion schedule implemented in
            this application. Your school determines retention and must arrange
            deletion, backups and recovery in line with its obligations. Subject
            to applicable law and recordkeeping requirements, contact your
            school or the privacy contact to request access, correction,
            deletion, restriction, or other applicable rights. You may raise a
            concern with the relevant data protection authority; in Nigeria this
            is the{" "}

            .
          </p>
          <h2>Children and sensitive information</h2>
          <p>
            Schools must limit collection to necessary information, restrict
            access, and involve parents or guardians where required. Do not
            upload unnecessary sensitive records. Contact your school if
            information has been collected without appropriate authorization.
          </p>
          <CookieDetails />
          <h2>Policy updates</h2>
          <p>
            Changes to processing or providers require this notice and cookie
            inventory to be reviewed. The displayed update date reflects the
            policy version or the latest operator-contact update.
