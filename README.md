# SMPIS

School Management, Performance and Intelligence System built with React, Express, Supabase PostgreSQL, and private Supabase Storage.

## Deploy to Vercel

1. Push this repository to GitHub and import it into Vercel using the **Express** framework preset and the repository root.
2. Add the environment variables listed in [the deployment guide](docs/VERCEL-DEPLOYMENT.md). Keep the same `INTEGRATION_ENCRYPTION_KEY` as your local `.env`.
3. Build with `npm run build:vercel`; frontend assets are built into `public`. Vercel searches the project root (`outputDirectory: "."`) for the Express entry point. These settings are already in `vercel.json`.
4. Deploy, check `/healthz`, and verify login, MFA, and document upload/download.

Before deploying schema changes, run locally with your private Supabase configuration:

```powershell
npm run supabase:setup
npm run supabase:check
```

## Local development

Requires Node.js 22.12 or later. Configure `.env` from `.env.example` without replacing existing credentials, then run:

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:3000. The first-run screen creates the school and initial super admin; no default accounts are supplied.

## Administration

Super admins manage school-specific SMTP, Paystack, Flutterwave, and Twilio credentials in **Administration > Integrations**. Secrets are encrypted and hidden after saving. SMTP and Paystack power the existing email and payment workflows. Flutterwave checkout and Twilio SMS delivery are not implemented.


## Verification

```powershell
npm test
npm run build:vercel
npm run test:ui
```

Browser tests use `dist`; run `npm run build` before `npm run test:ui`. Keep `.env`, school data, backups, and the encryption key private. Database recovery and document backups must be configured separately in Supabase.

Authentication rate limits are shared through PostgreSQL and apply by IP and account. Production mode (`npm start`, `NODE_ENV=production`, or Vercel) enables Secure session cookies and requires HTTPS for browser login. Run `npm run supabase:setup` before deploying these changes to create the rate-limit table and notification claim columns.

Email workers claim each notification for five minutes before sending; overlapping workers cannot claim the same active message, and expired claims can be retried. SMTP cannot guarantee exactly-once delivery if a worker stops after the provider accepts a message but before its sent status is saved. Password reset requests return the same public response for unknown accounts, missing school SMTP settings, and delivery failures; delivery failures are logged on the server.

## Legal pages and cookies

Terms, Privacy, and Cookies are public at `/terms`, `/privacy`, and `/cookies`. Super admins publish the operator name and privacy email in Administration > Site settings. The notice inventories the actual application cookies: `smpis_session` (8-hour, HttpOnly login session) and `smpis_cookie_preferences` (365-day notice preference, created on acceptance). No application analytics or advertising cookies are configured. The notice can be dismissed without saving a preference.

## Local database selection


Run `npm run build:vercel` followed by `node tests/site-browser.mjs` to verify public policy pages, cookie preferences, published legal contacts in Chrome against an isolated test database.

Supabase is the only database for development and deployment. Integration and browser tests require a separate PostgreSQL `TEST_DATABASE_URL`; each run creates and removes its own isolated schema. Without this variable, `npm test` runs the standalone checks and explicitly skips database integration tests. Tests never use your application `DATABASE_URL`.
