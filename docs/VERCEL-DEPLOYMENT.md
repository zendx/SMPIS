# Vercel deployment

The root `index.js` exports the Express application. Vite builds the frontend into `public`, which Vercel serves as static assets. The API uses Supabase PostgreSQL and private Supabase Storage; existing SMPIS authentication, MFA, and school permissions remain in place.

## Project settings

- Framework preset: **Express**
- Root directory: repository root
- Build command: `npm run build:vercel`
- Output directory: `public`
- Install command: default (`npm install`)

See [Vercel's Express deployment documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/backend/express).

## Environment variables

Add these under Vercel Project Settings > Environment Variables for each environment you deploy:

| Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Supabase pooler PostgreSQL connection string with your encoded database password and `sslmode=verify-full`. Use the exact string from Supabase's Connect panel. |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Your HTTPS Supabase project origin. |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Your server-only Supabase service-role key. |
| `SUPABASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` | Your private document bucket name, normally `school-documents`. |
| `INTEGRATION_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | The same 64-character hexadecimal key used in your private local `.env`. Preserve it across deployments and restores. |
| `DB_POOL_MAX` | `1` to bound connections per function instance. |
| `APP_URL` | The actual deployed HTTPS origin, used for password resets and payment callbacks. |
| `CRON_SECRET` | A long random secret protecting scheduled jobs. |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production`, to enable secure session cookies. |
| `TRUST_PROXY_HOPS` | `1`. |
| `REQUIRE_MFA` | `true`. |
| `DB_SSL_CA` | Optional trusted database certificate PEM, if required by your connection. |

Do not upload `.env` or put credentials in `VITE_` variables. SMTP and payment credentials can be entered later through Administration > Integrations. Environment `SMTP_URL`, `MAIL_FROM`, `PAYSTACK_SCHOOL_KEYS_JSON`, and `PAYSTACK_LIVE_ENABLED` remain optional compatibility defaults.

Generate a cron secret locally and save the output privately:

```powershell
node -p "require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex')"
```

If the project already has encrypted integration settings, reuse its existing encryption key rather than generating a replacement.

## Prepare Supabase

Keep your existing `.env`. For a new project, use `.env.example` as a template and replace all placeholders. Then run:

```powershell
npm run supabase:setup
npm run supabase:check
npm test
npm run build:vercel
```

Setup creates or updates application tables, enables RLS, removes direct browser-role grants, and creates the private bucket. Check verifies database access, table protection, and upload/download/delete. Neither command migrates existing local records. Run setup again before deploying schema changes; Vercel cold starts do not run schema migrations.

Documents are limited to 4 MB and PDF, PNG, or JPEG. Storage is private and accessed through authenticated API routes.

## Deploy and verify

Push the repository, import it into Vercel, add the variables, and deploy. When Vercel assigns the deployment URL, update `APP_URL` and redeploy if needed.

- `/healthz` should return `{"status":"ok"}`.
- Verify initial school setup or existing login and administrator MFA.
- Check frontend navigation, private document upload/download, and school access restrictions.
- Test SMTP delivery and Paystack test checkout after configuring those services.
- `/api/cron` must reject requests without the correct bearer secret.

The daily job runs at 02:00 UTC using `vercel.json`. Supabase database recovery and storage backups are separate from application deployment. Flutterwave checkout and Twilio SMS are not yet implemented.
